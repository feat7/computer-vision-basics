Computer Vision basics for AI Champ by Codevector Labs

# outline

- Computer Vision history and inspiration from the human vision.
- Overview of mathematics will help you understand the language used in computer vision. Mostly contains matrix operations.
- Understanding what an image is to a computer, the coordinate system of the image, overview of some operations that can be performed on the image/videos.
- Mini project - Image processing exercise with NumPy and OpenCV. Understand popular kernels - Sobel, Laplacian, Gaussian.
- Mini project - Background Subtraction, Motion Detection, Contour Detection.
- CNN and its components - Similarity with ANN, Convolution operation, Kernels, Activation Maps, Pooling, Padding, Flattening, FCN.
- Mini project - Training a deep learning model (CNN) with Keras/Tensorflow/Pytorch on a standard dataset.
- Understanding the general problems and some tips to train the model - Same as deep learning but more specific to CNNs. eg. Different - Augmentation techniques, Using different architectures of CNN models for your use case, BatchNormalization, etc.
